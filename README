The ECE492 Lab now has a local router that we can connect to and establish a local connection with our raspberry pi.

Router configurations: 
Name: CEC492_E3011
Password: 1103E_294ECE

To establish connection with raspberry pi in the lab either:

1. Flash raspberry pi with the configurations of the router.
2. SSH to raspberry pi

or

1. Connect to the rapsberry pi with the dongle.

Thank you Steve Drake!!!
